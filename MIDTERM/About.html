        <h1>About Super Smash Bros.:</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Super Smash Bros is a party figthing game created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masahiro_Sakurai">Mashiro Sakurai</a> (pictured below). The series has had 5 unique installments, with each new installment building upon the last.
            Although, some installments have scrapped some characters, stages, and features from previous. 
            The latest game to the Super Smash Bros. series is "Super Smash Bros. Ultimate." As the intended last Super Smash Bros. game and as the marketing campaign promised, within Ultimate, "Everyone is Here!"
            This means that even characters and stages that were discarded between previous installments in the series are in Ultimate. On top of that, there have been multiple fighters and stages added for the launch of Ultimate and as dlc.
