    <h3>Description</h3>

    <!--links for a description of the possible unknown terms are inserted where the first instance of that word is on the webpage
    added a margin for the image so that the text isn't right up against the image-->
    <img src="caffeine.jpg" width="150" height="150" align="left" style="margin:5px"/>
    <p>College students consume surprising quantities of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine">caffeine</a> on average. This study seeks to determine if a correlation exists between the amount 
        of caffeine an individual consumes daily and that individual's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_in_education">grade point average in school.</a></p>
    <p>The initial experiment included a group, which received daily caffeine equal to the national average (Group A), a group which received twice the
         national daily average (Group B), and a control group which received a placebo (Group C). </p>
    <p>Preliminary results indicate that average consumption of daily caffeine led to a slight and steady increase in GPA throughout the term. A higher than
         average consumption of caffeine led to higher GPA initially, but then grades fell off towards the end of the semester. Finally, no consumption of caffeine led to neither a significant increase or decrease in overall GPA performance.</p>

    <h3>Steps to Reproduce</h3>

    <!--ordered list for the steps to reproduce-->
    <ol>
        <li>100 students were selected from volunteer applicants between the ages of 18-22 years old, with equal numbers of female and male participants and with a starting GPA between 3.2 and 3.3.</li>
        <li>Each student was assigned a number from 1-100</li>
        <li>Numbers were then randomly selected and assigned to groups A, B, and C</li>
        <li>Group A was given caffeine equivalent to 3 cups of coffee per day (the national average)</li>
        <li>Group B was given caffeine equivalent to 6 cups of coffee per day</li>
        <li>Group C was given a placebo</li>
        <li>Grade point averages were tracked throughout the term and averaged by group at the start of the semester, at midterm, and after final grades were submitted</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Data</h3>

    <!--put a border on the table cause the default looked nasty
    Also made the the row and column headings as table heading to emphasize what each row and column shows
    Changed the table so that when the score goes up on a group the background is green and if the score goes down the background is red-->
    <table border="6">
        <tr>
            <td></td>
            <th>Starting Average:</th>
