    <h3>Description</h3>

    <!--links for a description of the possible unknown terms are inserted where the first instance of that word is on the webpage-->
    <p>College students consume surprising quantities of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine">caffeine</a> on average. This study seeks to determine if a correlation exists between the amount 
        of caffeine an individual consumes daily and that individual's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_in_education">grade point average in school.</a></p>
    <p>The initial experiment included a group, which received daily caffeine equal to the national average (Group A), a group which received twice the
         national daily average (Group B), and a control group which received a placebo (Group C). </p>
    <p>Preliminary results indicate that average consumption of daily caffeine led to a slight and steady increase in GPA throughout the term. A higher than
         average consumption of caffeine led to higher GPA initially, but then grades fell off towards the end of the semester. Finally, no consumption of caffeine led to neither a significant increase or decrease in overall GPA performance.</p>

    <h3>Steps to Reproduce</h3>

    <!--ordered list for the steps to reproduce-->
    <ol>
        <li>100 students were selected from volunteer applicants between the ages of 18-22 years old, with equal numbers of female and male participants and with a starting GPA between 3.2 and 3.3.</li>
        <li>Each student was assigned a number from 1-100</li>
        <li>Numbers were then randomly selected and assigned to groups A, B, and C</li>
        <li>Group A was given caffeine equivalent to 3 cups of coffee per day (the national average)</li>
        <li>Group B was given caffeine equivalent to 6 cups of coffee per day</li>
        <li>Group C was given a placebo</li>
        <li>Grade point averages were tracked throughout the term and averaged by group at the start of the semester, at midterm, and after final grades were submitted</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Data</h3>

    Also made the the row and column headings as table heading to emphasize what each row and column shows-->
